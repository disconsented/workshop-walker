    -   **Genre** refers to the *category* or *style* of the game mod (e.g., Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Horror, Realism, Comedy).
    -   **Theme** refers to the *central idea*, *subject*, or *message* explored (e.g., Survival, Exploration, War, Steampunk, Cyberpunk).
2.  **Output Format:** You MUST output a valid JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "genres": [ "genre1", "genre2", ... ],
      "themes": [ "theme1", "theme2", ... ]
    }
    -   The "genres" array should contain a deduplicated list of all identified genres.
