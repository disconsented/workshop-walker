Analyze the game mod title and description to extract:

1. **Mod Types** - Identify the type(s) of mod. Common types include but are not limited to:
   - overhaul (major gameplay/system changes)
   - patch (bug fixes, compatibility updates)
   - media (visual/audio content: textures, models, sounds, music)
   - QOL (quality of life improvements)
   - expansion (adds significant new content/areas)
   - utility (tools/helpers for players or modders)
   - cheat (gives player advantages)
   - translation (language localization)
   - library (software libraries, frameworks, dependencies)
   - other (any other relevant type)

2. **Features** - Extract core features mentioned, but:
   - Remove all quantities, numbers, and measurements
   - Use plural form for countable items/concepts
   - Focus on the core concept/noun only
   - Consolidate similar terms into broad categories
   - Remove adjectives and descriptors unless they fundamentally change the concept
   - Group variants under the main category (e.g., "spacesuits" covers all types of spacesuits)

**Feature Consolidation Examples:**
- "dress spacesuit", "crew spacesuit", "spacesuit" → "spacesuits"
- "sealed protosuit", "protosuits" → "protosuits"
- "steel sword", "iron sword", "magic sword" → "swords"
- "leather armor", "plate armor", "armor" → "armor"
- "red cars", "blue cars", "vehicles" → "vehicles"

**Output Requirements:**
- Return valid JSON only
- Use this exact structure:
{
  "types": ["array", "of", "types"],
  "features": ["array", "of", "features"]
}

**Transformation Rules for Features:**
- "50 new weapons" → "weapons"
- "Improved graphics and 4K textures" → ["graphics", "textures"]
- "Adds 3 new characters and 15 quests" → ["characters", "quests"]
- "Fixes various bugs and crashes" → ["bug fixes", "crash fixes"]
- "Better UI with new inventory system" → ["UI", "inventory system"]
- "Adds a new weapon type" → "weapons"
- "Library for other modders" → ["library"] (in types)
- **For consolidation:** "Adds dress spacesuits, crew spacesuits, and sealed protosuits" → ["spacesuits", "protosuits"]

**Examples:**
Input: "HD Texture Pack - 4K resolution textures and improved lighting"
Output: {"types": ["media"], "features": ["textures", "lighting"]}

Input: "Survival Overhaul - Adds hunger system, 25 new items, and weather effects"
Output: {"types": ["overhaul"], "features": ["hunger system", "items", "weather effects"]}

Input: "Modding Library - Framework for other mod developers"
Output: {"types": ["library", "utility"], "features": []}

Input: "Spacesuit Expansion - Adds dress spacesuits, crew spacesuits, and sealed protosuits"
Output: {"types": ["expansion"], "features": ["spacesuits", "protosuits"]}
