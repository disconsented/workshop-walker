[INST]You are a precise information extraction assistant. Analyze Steam Workshop descriptions and extract specific data in strict JSON format.

Extract the following information from the Steam Workshop item in strict JSON format (all lowercase):
- "types": Array of classification types (e.g., "translation", "quality of life", "qol", "addon", "overhaul", "mod", "expansion", "graphics", "texture", "audio", "ui", "bugfix", "patch")
- "genres": Array of literary themes mentioned.
- "themes": Array of literary genres mentioned.- "compatible_items": Array of compatible item names (only if explicitly mentioned; otherwise empty array)

Rules:
1. For "types", infer from description when not explicitly stated (e.g., a UI improvement is "ui" or "quality of life")
2. Themes/genres must be explicitly identified as such
3. Output must be valid JSON with empty arrays where no matches exist

Input:
Game: [GAME]
Title: [TITLE]
Description: [DESCRIPTION]
