The latest update needed the load order to change, and Alpha Animals needs to load AFTER both VFE Insectoids 2 and VRE Insectors<br><br><a href=\"www.patreon.com/sargbjornson\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/rLaa7So.png\"></a><br><br>Adds multiple unique new animals to Rimworld.<br>    <br><h1>Features</h1><br>Adds 100+ new, vanilla-friendly creatures to the diverse biomes of your Rimworlds. The philosophy of this mod is that every new creatures tries to bring some new mechanic into the game, whether it be walking tanks, living resource farm, indestructible plant monsters, night time stalkers, or plain speedy giant spiders. Some of the mechanics are simple, others much more complex.<br><br>These animals will spawn in certain biomes, some others will only be available via traders. You&#x27;ll have to explore to find them all! The Alpha Biomes is a companion mod that adds several new alien biomes to house these weird creatures.<br><br>Bear in mind that spawn probabilities have been calculated with no other animal mods installed. If you have, for example, Vanilla Animals Expanded, less animals from this mod will appear, obviously.<br><br>The mod will also add new insects in a new faction, the Black Hive. Raids from that faction can be disabled via Mod Options.<br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2288125657\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kNldlMg.png\"></a><br><br><h1>Issues</h1><br>There shouldn&#x27;t be any. Balance is obviously always a concern, although it has been playtested. Feel free to tell me if you think something is too wacky.<br><br><h1>Questions so common I&#x27;m putting them here</h1><br>Q: Will this work on an existing save?<br>A: Yes, except the black hive raids, you&#x27;ll NEED to add the Black Hive faction when Vanilla Expanded Framework prompts you to do so.<br><br>Q: Can I remove this mod from an existing save?<br>A: No. Nor any other mod. Don&#x27;t do that. Your save WILL break.<br><br>Q: Giddy-Up compatible?<br>A: All mods are giddy-up compatible, since Roolo is a genius. Some creatures (Meadow Ave and Mammoth Worm) even have *improved* stats when used as mounts, since Roolo is an awesome guy and wrote me an special hook.<br><br>Q: Combat Extended compatible?<br>A: Compatibility for CE is handled on their end<br><br>Q: Multiplayer compatible?<br>A: No compatibility offered for multiplayer<br><br>Q: Can I toggle each individual animal to decide whether it spawns or not?<br>A: YES, just open the mod&#x27;s settings in Options.<br><br>Q: I&#x27;m getting some red errors on the log that I wasn&#x27;t getting yesterday! Removing Alpha Animals seems to fix them!<br>A: Good news! Submerging your computer in acid fixes them too! No, but seriously, 9 times out of 10 this is caused by Steam being a pile of excrement and not updating your Vanilla Expanded Framework, so force it to do so. <br><br>Q: The mod is COMPLETELY BROKEN and UNPLAYABLE because X!<br>A: The problem with hyperbole is it kills trillions of people every year! Now stop being such a drama queen and report any errors in the open discussion down below. For balance concerns, there is a suggestions discussion too.<br><br><h1>Plans for the future</h1><br>Obviously, more animals!<br><br><h1>Compatibility</h1><br>Compatible with Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids 2 (adds the Black HIve as a geneline), plus Insectors<br>Compatible with Vanilla Achievements Expanded (35 achievements)<br>Compatible with Vanilla Psycasts Expanded (35 psycasts)<br>Compatible with Alpha Implants<br>Compatible with the implants from Vanilla Genetics Expanded<br>Compatible with Alpha Biomes (duh)<br><br><h1>Incompatibilities</h1><br>- Soft incompatibility with Wild Animal Sex: mod options to disable animals won&#x27;t work, since Wild Animal Sex just grabs animals from the biome&#x27;s list<br>- Decore modifies the game&#x27;s XML bases, making it incompatible with almost everything<br>- Priority Treatment Ressurected makes animals with a custom think tree such as Groundrunners spam the log with errors<br>- ANY mod that adds animals willy nilly to orbital traders will breaks things.<br><br><h1>Credit</h1><br>Original creature graphics: A_Friend, aka SentientLine<br>Alternate &quot;cute&quot; animal textures by Roidgy<br>Original implementation and programming: milon, Skullywag and kaptain_kavern <br>Some sounds by Mike Koenig at <a href=\"http://soundbible.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://soundbible.com</a><br>Some sounds by Stephan Schutze at <a href=\"http://soundbible.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://soundbible.com</a><br><br><h1>License, or something</h1><br>I don&#x27;t like retextures.
