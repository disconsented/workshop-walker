Nara an Interstellar Industries Complex initiated the project of semi-automated war-machines, which aimed at creating a legion of war-machines with low technology and maintenance requirements to aid humans in all galaxies in the war against all those threats.<br><br>It was a quite successful project, and as countless fleets of unknown generations of ships marched toward the borders of human civilization, the production technology of these weapons also spread in the edge world... until today.<br><br><h1>Introduction</h1>This is a large-scale mod that was created around the cyberpunk theme of the 1990s. It has a lot of content, including heavy metallic weapons, industrial-tactical robots, and bio-mech bionic, so I don’t intend to teach you how to play it.

I apologize to everyone who has been waiting for this mod for a long time (it’s been a while). Making such a big project is well-challenged.<br><br>DMS is a response that condenses my experience and understanding of countless works to the world and those works and creators who have profoundly affected my life.<br>Completing this project, which included my understanding of Rimworld art and those coolish Science Fiction styles, is also the realization of my dream of creating cool mecha works since I was a child.<br>Therefore, it is quite a torment in terms of technology, time, development enthusiasm, and progress management.<br>From the beginning of the project to the release, it spanned two game versions. Countless setbacks and subversions made me doubt my motivation to continue doing it more than once and questioned whether my work and abilities met expectations...<br><br>But this has all passed, and I have reached a reconciliation between my heavy academic workload and my pursuit of excellence. It was unanimously decided to release the mod before the end of 2023. Which is today.<br>Although there may still be some minor problems, anyway still hope you enjoy it. _AOBA 2023/12/25<br><br>If you find any problems or have any ideas while playing, you can give feedback to the Discord group<br><a href=\"https://discord.gg/Pvj5Xj3yBm\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/CHY91mx/discord-Icon.png\"></a><br><a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/AobaKuma\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/cLqX4rv/Paypal-Icon.png\"></a><br><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/aobakuma\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KhN0Tgp/Ko-Fi-Icon.png\"></a><br><br><br>"
